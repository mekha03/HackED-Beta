# HackED Beta Project - Energy Conserver💡
🏆Winners of **1st Place** Hardware Project🏆
## Inspiration
The cost of energy is increasing everyday. We wanted to help people save electricity and reduce their energy bills. 

## What it does
It keeps track of how long your lights are on, and reports the time to you. It also gives you notifications when your lights have been on for an extended period of time to remind you to turn them off. 

## How we built it
**Hardware:**
- Utilized an Arduino Uno, a breadboard, and an LED light.
- Connected the LED to a specific pin on the Arduino.
- Used a voltage reading from an analog pin to determine the light state.

**Software:**
- Implemented the project using the Arduino programming language.
- Incorporated conditional statements to track time, energy usage, and control the LED.

**Notification System:**
- Incorporated a notification system to alert the user after 2 hours of continuous light usage.

## Challenges we ran into
**Fluctuations in Voltage Reading:**
Addressed challenges related to voltage reading fluctuations impacting time tracking.

**Data Visualization Complexity:**
Considering potential challenges in implementing data visualization with Python.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Learning Arduino coding in less than a day
- Winning First Place Hardware Project!! 🥳

## What we learned
**Arduino Programming:**
- Enhanced skills in Arduino programming and hardware interfacing.
- Learned how to use Arduino IDE from scratch (all in one day)

**Time Tracking:**
- Learned techniques for accurate time tracking using Arduino.

**Electrical Components:**
- Got a deeper understanding of breadboarding
- Learned about LCDs, buttons, and LEDS

## What's next for Energy Conserver - AssortedFruits
**Expansion:**
- We want to expand to more light/energy sources

**Data Visualization**
- We want to provide a visual of energy usage (line graph over multiple days/weeks/etc.)

**User Interface**
- We want to make an app that gives the user the following options:
          --> Allows user to set their notification interval
          --> When the user receives the notification, it gives them the option to turn off the energy source.
